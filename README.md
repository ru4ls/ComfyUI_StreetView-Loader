## Why Use This Node? The Power of "Ground Truth"

While standard text-to-image models are incredible at *imagining* locations ("a charming street in Paris"), they struggle to recreate the **exact appearance and layout** of a specific, real-world place. Their output is an approximation, an artistic blend of countless images.

This node solves that problem by providing **photographic ground truth**. It pulls the real, pixel-for-pixel view of a location, ensuring your generations are anchored in reality.

This gives you the best of both worlds: the authenticity of a real photograph combined with the creative power of AI.

### Key Advantages & Use Cases

*   **Guaranteed Location Accuracy:** When you need the background to be recognizably *your* street, a specific landmark, or a favorite travel spot, this node is the only way to guarantee a 100% accurate representation.
*   **The Ultimate Base for ControlNet:** Feed the real Street View image into your workflow as a base for stylization (anime, oil painting), re-imagining (futuristic, historical), or precise inpainting.
*   **Virtual Location Scouting:** Instantly scout real-world locations from your desktop and experiment with different styles and moods for your project.
*   **Personalized & Sentimental Art:** Create unique art based on a place with personal meaning—a childhood home, a proposal spot, or a favorite vacation view.
*   **Consistent Backgrounds for Testing:** Use a consistent, real-world background to reliably test LoRAs, IPAdapters, or character models.
*   **Animation Capabilities:** Create smooth camera movements and parameter transitions with the new Street View Animator node (v1.01).

## 3. How to Use & Workflow

The recommended workflow is to use the **URL Parser** node to feed information into the other nodes.

1.  **Find your view** in [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) and enter Street View.
2.  Frame the perfect shot, then **copy the entire URL** from your browser's address bar.
3.  In ComfyUI, add the **`Street View URL Parser`** node and paste the URL into it.
4.  Add one of the loader nodes.
5.  Connect the outputs of the Parser to the inputs of the loader (`location` to `location`, etc.).

### Node Descriptions

## Street View URL Parser

This node takes a full Google Maps URL as input and outputs the camera parameters (`location`, `heading`, `pitch`, `fov`).

**`Street View Loader`**
This is the main node that fetches the image.
-   **`aspect_ratio`**: Choose your desired output aspect ratio from the dropdown. This replaces manual width/height inputs.
-   **API Limit & Upscaling:** The Google Street View API has a maximum output size of **640x640 pixels**. For high-resolution images (like 1080p or 4K), you **must** use an upscaling workflow.
-   **Recommended HD Workflow:**
    1.  Select `"16:9 Widescreen (640x360)"` in the `Street View Loader`.
    2.  Connect its `IMAGE` output to an **`Upscale Image (using model)`** node.
    3.  Use a `Load Upscale Model` node (e.g., `4x-UltraSharp`) to get a final, high-quality **2560x1440** image.

## Street View Pano Loader

For users who need to create wide, cinematic landscapes, the project includes the **Street View Pano Loader** node.

This node overcomes the API's FOV limitations by using a sophisticated stitching algorithm. It fetches multiple overlapping image "tiles" and then uses the OpenCV library to analyze, warp, and seamlessly blend them into a single, perspective-corrected panoramic image.

![Street View Pano Loader Node result](https://github.com/ru4ls/ru4ls-public-media/blob/main/comfyui-streetview-loader/images/StreetView_Pano_00010_.png)

### How to Use & Parameter Suggestions

1.  Add the **"Street View Pano Loader"** node to your canvas.
2.  Provide a `location` and `center_heading` (the direction you want the middle of your panorama to face).
3.  Fine-tune the parameters for a successful stitch:
    -   **`overlap_percentage`**: This is the most critical setting. For OpenCV to work, it needs to see the same features in adjacent images. An overlap of **30-50%** is a great starting point. **If a stitch fails, increase this value first.**
    -   **`fov_per_image`**: A narrower Field of View (like 70-80) can reduce distortion at the edges of each tile, making it easier for the algorithm to find matching points. However, you may need to increase the `num_images` to capture the same total width.
    -   **`num_images`**: Controls the final width of your panorama. Start with 3 and increase if needed.

### Understanding the Output: Warping & Black Borders

A successful, high-quality stitch will **not** be a perfect rectangle. To correctly align the perspectives, the stitcher "warps" the flat photos onto a virtual cylinder.

**The curved edges and black borders are not an error; they are proof that the perspective correction worked!** This warped image is now a seamless, geometrically correct panorama, ready for refinement.

### Refining Your Panorama: Optional Next Steps

Once you have your stitched result, you have two great options to create a final, rectangular image:

**1. Cropping (The Simple Method)**
-   **Goal:** To get a clean, cinematic widescreen image.
-   **How:** Connect the `IMAGE` output from the Pano Loader to a `Crop` node in ComfyUI. Adjust the crop box to frame the best part of the scene and remove the black areas.

**2. AI Outpainting (The Advanced Method)**
-   **Goal:** To use AI to intelligently fill in the missing areas, creating a larger, natural-looking scene.
-   **How:** Feed the panoramic image into your main workflow (`VAE Encode`, `KSampler`, etc.) with a descriptive prompt of the scene and a **low denoise** (e.g., 0.3-0.5). The AI will use the existing pixels as a guide to generate new details in the black corners.

## Street View Animator (v1.0.1)

Version 1.0.1 introduces the **Street View Animator** node, which allows you to create animated sequences by smoothly transitioning camera parameters over time.

This node enables you to create dynamic camera movements like slow rotations, pitch changes, or field-of-view adjustments that can be used as input for video generation workflows or simply to create smooth transitions between different viewpoints of the same location.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7edbbdf8-2dcd-4e0c-aae0-ccc5ad1be679


### How to Use & Parameter Suggestions

1.  Add the **"Street View Animator"** node to your canvas.
2.  Provide a `location` (same as other nodes).
3.  Set your animation parameters:
    -   **Start/End Values:** Define the beginning and ending values for `heading`, `pitch`, and `fov` parameters.
    -   **Duration & FPS:** Control the total animation length and frame rate (frames per second).
    -   **Interpolation:** Choose from different transition types (linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out) for smooth camera movements.
    -   **aspect_ratio:** Select your desired output aspect ratio.

4.  The node will generate a sequence of images as a stacked tensor output, which can be used for:
    -   Video generation workflows
    -   Frame-by-frame processing
    -   Creating dynamic backgrounds for animations

### Key Animation Parameters

-   **Start/End Heading:** Control camera rotation from start to end values (0-360 degrees)
-   **Start/End Pitch:** Adjust camera tilt from start to end values (-90 to 90 degrees) 
-   **Start/End FOV:** Change field of view from start to end values (10-120 degrees)
-   **Duration:** Total animation time in seconds
-   **FPS:** Frames per second - determines smoothness and total frame count
-   **Interpolation:** Defines how values transition between start and end points

### Animation Tips

-   **Smooth Rotations:** For a full 360° rotation, set start_heading=0 and end_heading=360
-   **Camera Dolly:** Keep heading constant but change fov for zoom effects
-   **Tilt Effects:** Combine pitch changes with heading changes for dynamic camera movements
-   **Frame Count:** Total frames = duration × fps (higher values = smoother but may increase API usage costs)

## Street View Cubemap Loader (v1.0.2)

Version 1.02 introduces the **Street View Cubemap Loader** node, which enables the generation of 3D environment maps from Street View locations. This node fetches six images at specific orientations to create a complete cubemap suitable for 3D applications and environment mapping in game engines or rendering software.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f9b3771-ee5d-449a-97fe-b884d33b950b


### How to Use & Parameter Suggestions

1.  Add the **"Street View Cubemap Loader"** node to your canvas.
2.  Provide a `location` (same as other nodes) for the center point of your environment map.
3.  Adjust the parameters as needed:
    -   **`face_resolution`**: Select the resolution for each of the 6 cubemap faces. Options include 256x256, 512x512, 640x640, and 1024x1024. Higher resolutions provide better quality but require more API requests and resources.
    -   **`output_mode`**: Choose how to output the cubemap faces:
        - **individual_faces**: Outputs six separate image tensors (front, back, left, right, up, down)
        - **merged_cross**: Combines all faces into a single cross-shaped layout texture
        - **merged_hstrip**: Combines all faces into a horizontal strip layout
        - **merged_vstrip**: Combines all faces into a vertical strip layout


4.  The node will generate outputs based on the selected output mode:
    -   **Individual faces** (when selected): Six separate image outputs representing the six faces of the cube map:
        -   **Front**: The view facing forward from the location (0° heading, 0° pitch)
        -   **Back**: The view facing backward from the location (180° heading, 0° pitch)
        -   **Left**: The view facing left from the location (270° heading, 0° pitch)
        -   **Right**: The view facing right from the location (90° heading, 0° pitch)
        -   **Up**: The view looking upward from the location (0° heading, 85° pitch) - note slightly less than 90° to work with API limitations
        -   **Down**: The view looking downward from the location (0° heading, -85° pitch) - note slightly less than -90° to work with API limitations
    -   **Merged texture** (when selected): A single image tensor containing all six faces arranged according to the selected layout

### Use Cases for Cubemap Output

- **3D Environment Mapping**: Use the cubemap output as an environment map for 3D scenes in Blender, Unity, or Unreal Engine
- **Background Texturing**: Create realistic backgrounds for 3D scenes with accurate real-world lighting information
- **VR Applications**: Generate real-world environments for virtual reality experiences
- **Reflection Probes**: Use in rendering pipelines for accurate reflections and lighting calculations
- **Easy 3D Integration**: The merged output modes make it simple to use cubemaps directly in 3D engines without manual texture assembly

### Important Notes

- **API Usage**: This node makes six API calls (one for each face of the cube). Each cubemap generation will count as **6 requests** against your free monthly Google Cloud credit.
- **API Limitations**: The Street View API might not return valid images for extreme pitch angles. The node uses 85° and -85° for the up and down faces to avoid common API limitations at exactly 90° vertical pitch.
- **Resolution Constraints**: Each face will be limited by the Street View API's maximum output size of 640x640 pixels. For higher resolutions, you'll need to upscale the results using ComfyUI's upscaling nodes after generation.
- **Memory Considerations**: The merged output modes will create larger textures (e.g., cross layout is 4x width by 3x height of individual faces) so consider your system's memory limitations when choosing high resolutions.

### Important Notes for All Nodes

-   **API Usage:** All nodes make API requests against your Google Cloud monthly credit.
-   **API Limitations:** The Street View API may not have coverage for all locations or may return black images for extreme angles or unavailable locations.
-   **Resolution Constraints:** The maximum resolution from the API is 640x640 pixels per image. For higher-resolution results, use ComfyUI's upscaling nodes.


## 7. Troubleshooting

-   **`ValueError: API key not found`:** Your `.env` file is missing, in the wrong location, or the variable name is not `GOOGLE_STREET_VIEW_API_KEY`.
-   **Black Image Output:** This usually means Google has no Street View imagery for that coordinate, or your API key is invalid/restricted. Check your key's restrictions on the Google Cloud Console.
-   **Node not appearing in ComfyUI:** Ensure you have fully restarted the ComfyUI server after installation.
